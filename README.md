# Simulation-and-Analysis-of-TCP-Congestion-Control-Variants

In this project, we have simulated TCP Congestion in a network and analyzed some of the TCP variants on the basis of performance, fairness and influences on them due to queuing algorithms.

**TCP variants considered are:**
* TCP Tahoe
* TCP Reno
* TCP New Reno
* TCP Vegas 
* TCP SACK 

**In the Simulation and Analysis section:**

* Simulation of TCP Congestion in a Network is performed using Cisco Packet Tracer Simulator by setting up an appropriate topology involving client and server. After setting up the network, HTTP traffic, which is handled by TCP, is generated from each Client to the Server and Packet Loss at Server has been finally shown.

* Performance Comparison of TCP variants has been done which is based on throughput, packet drop rate and latency. 

* Analysis of Fairness between TCP variants has been done which is based on throughput. 

* An analysis and comparison of the influence of the queuing disciplines namely: DropTail and Random Early Drop (RED) on TCP Reno with and without Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) by means of Average Bandwidth and Average Latency is also performed.
